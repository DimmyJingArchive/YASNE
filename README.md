# Yet Another Socket Networking Example
This is another networking example I have been working on. It is a little more complicated than the others, but it teaches me, and hopefully others how to properly do networking with sockets. Porting to windows is still WIP.

Usage:
+ go to the directory called server, and type 'make'
+ do the same with the directory called client
+ the code is self explanitory, but the source files is in src
